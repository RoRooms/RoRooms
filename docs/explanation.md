# What is RoRooms?

RoRooms is an all-in-one framework and network for social experiences, providing both social features, and a universal network of worlds.

## Goals 🎯

- Streamline the creation of social worlds ⚡
- Offer a superior experience for players ✨
- Uplift the social genre 📈

## Features 📃

- **👤 Profiles** - Change your nickname & bio
- **🔧 Items** - Access roleplay items
- **💃 Emotes** - Use emotes
- **👥 Friends** - Join & invite friends
- **🌐 Worlds** - Discover worlds
- **⚙️ Settings** - Mute music, hide UI, etc

## Worlds Network 🌐

RoRooms provides its own network of worlds, secured via peer-to-peer ranking based on received teleports. At scale, this creates a network effect, where worlds promote similar worlds, and the network is uplifted as a whole.

## The Players 🙌

Players always come first, and they appreciate a superior experience. By giving them these features, and allowing them to traverse worlds so seamlessly, they'll *(theoretically)* spend more time in social worlds as a whole.
