# What is RoRooms?

RoRooms is an all-in-one framework and network for social experiences, providing both social features, and a universal network of worlds.

# Goals 🎯

- Streamline the creation of social worlds ⚡
- Offer a superior experience for players ✨
- Uplift the social genre 📈

## Features 📃

- **👤 Profiles** - Change your nickname & bio
- **🔧 Items** - Access roleplay items
- **💃 Emotes** - Use emotes
- **👥 Friends** - Join & invite friends
- **🌐 Worlds** - Discover worlds
- **⚙️ Settings** - Mute music, hide UI, etc

## Worlds Network 🌐

RoRooms provides its own network of worlds, secured via peer-to-peer ranking based on received teleports. At scale, this creates a network effect, where worlds promote similar worlds, and the network is uplifted as a whole.

## The Players 🙌

Players always come first, and they appreciate a superior experience. By giving them these features, and allowing them to traverse worlds so seamlessly, they'll *(theoretically)* spend more time in social worlds as a whole.

# Monetization 💸

Ways for developers to self-monetize via RoRooms' features are being actively looked into. Specifically support for the following:

- Gamepass-locked items 🔧
- Gamepass-locked emotes 💃
- Gamepass-locked zones 🗺️

## RoRooms Plus ➕

- 📆 RoRooms Plus, a player-facing subscription is in consideration, likely to be implemented once Roblox releases third-party subscriptions.
- ⚙️ As with everything in RoRooms, you will be able to configure or disable this feature.
- ❤️ If Roblox supports affiliate earnings, you will earn a cut of RoRooms Plus revenue when sold from within your world.
