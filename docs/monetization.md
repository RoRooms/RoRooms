## Gamepasses 🔒

To restrict certain features based on gamepass ownership, apply `GamepassRequirement` onto them. This works with items, emotes, locked zones, and locked doors.

## RoRooms Plus ➕

- 📆 RoRooms Plus, a player-facing subscription is in consideration, likely to be implemented once Roblox releases third-party subscriptions.
- ❤️ If Roblox supports affiliate earnings, you will earn a cut of RoRooms Plus revenue when sold from within your world. Roblox's support for this is not guaranteed.
- ⚙️ As with everything in RoRooms, you will be able to configure or disable this feature.
