## Rorooms Plus ➕

- 📆 Rorooms Plus, a player-facing subscription is in consideration, likely to be implemented once Roblox releases third-party subscriptions.
- ❤️ If Roblox supports affiliate earnings, you will earn a cut of Rorooms Plus revenue when sold from within your world. Roblox's support for this is not guaranteed.
- ⚙️ As with everything in Rorooms, you will be able to configure or disable this feature.
